      The Training Studio App is a `Lightning App <https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lightning>`_ that enables you to quickly perform machine-learning research in collaborative ways by bringing
      all the tools you need in a single place (notebook, tensorboard, wandb, sweeps, etc...) and is runnable locally or on `lightning.ai <https://lightning.ai/>`_ platform.

********************************
The Training Studio App Benefits
********************************

The Training Studio App builds on the Lightning HPO Sweep Component to provide a way to manage sweeps and accelerate ML development with some added benefits:

* A Command-Line Interface to run your local scripts as sweeps or create development tools such as notebooks.
* A React UI to easily keep track of your sweeps and tools.
* Ability to run the Training Studio App on your own GPU machines (on-prem) or on `lightning.ai <https://lightning.ai/>`_ cloud platform.
* Ability to have several users connect to the same App and collaborate together.
* Organize your sweeps checkpoints or logging with several loggers of your choice such as Wandb, Tensorboard.
